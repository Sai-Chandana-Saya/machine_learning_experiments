**Summary**

I will explore the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment and trader performance by analyzing two datasets: the Market Sentiment dataset and the Historical Hyperliquid trading data. 
My objective is to identify hidden patterns that show how Fear and Greed influence trading outcomes, such as profitability and position management. By uncovering these insights, I aim to develop recommendations that can drive smarter, data-driven trading strategies.
